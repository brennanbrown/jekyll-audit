# Jekyll-Audit: NPM Package Specification Sheet

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the specification for `jekyll-audit`, an npm package designed to provide a comprehensive testing and auditing framework for Jekyll static sites. The goal of `jekyll-audit` is to offer an integrated solution for developers to ensure the quality, performance, accessibility, and SEO-friendliness of their Jekyll projects, addressing a current gap in the Jekyll ecosystem for dedicated testing tools.

## 2. Background and Motivation

Jekyll is a popular static site generator known for its simplicity and flexibility. However, as Jekyll sites grow in complexity, ensuring their quality across various dimensions becomes challenging. Current testing approaches for Jekyll sites are often fragmented, relying on manual checks, general web testing frameworks, or external auditing services. There is no single, integrated tool that allows Jekyll developers to perform automated, comprehensive audits directly within their development workflow.

`jekyll-audit` aims to fill this void by providing a unified command-line interface (CLI) that orchestrates various auditing capabilities, making it easier for developers to identify and rectify issues related to performance, accessibility, SEO, broken links, and more. By integrating with existing open-source tools where appropriate, `jekyll-audit` will offer a powerful yet user-friendly solution for maintaining high-quality Jekyll sites.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of `jekyll-audit` is to empower Jekyll developers with an automated, comprehensive, and easy-to-use testing and auditing framework. Specific objectives include:

*   To provide a single npm package for performing various types of audits on Jekyll sites.
*   To integrate with or leverage established open-source auditing tools for specialized checks (e.g., Lighthouse for performance, Axe-core for accessibility).
*   To offer a configurable and extensible framework that allows users to customize audit rules and add new checks.
*   To generate clear, actionable reports that highlight issues and suggest remedies.
*   To support integration into Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines for automated quality assurance.
*   To promote best practices in web development for Jekyll users.

## 4. Target Audience

`jekyll-audit` is primarily intended for:

*   **Jekyll Developers:** Individuals and teams building and maintaining Jekyll websites.
*   **Web Developers:** Anyone working with static sites who needs a robust auditing tool.
*   **CI/CD Engineers:** Professionals looking to automate quality checks in their deployment pipelines.
*   **Content Creators:** Bloggers and writers using Jekyll who want to ensure their content is well-optimized and accessible.

## 5. Functional Requirements

`jekyll-audit` will provide the following core functionalities:

### 5.1. Performance Audits

### 5.5. Reporting

*   **Console Output:** Provide concise, human-readable summaries in the command line.
*   **Detailed Reports:** Generate comprehensive reports in various formats (e.g., JSON, HTML, Markdown) that include:
    *   Overall audit score (if applicable).
    *   Categorized list of issues (performance, accessibility, SEO, etc.).
    *   Detailed descriptions of each issue.
    *   Suggested remedies and links to relevant documentation.
*   **Customizable Thresholds:** Allow users to define acceptable thresholds for various metrics (e.g., Lighthouse scores) to fail builds in CI.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1. Usability

*   **CLI-first:** Primarily operated via a command-line interface.
*   **Easy Installation:** Installable via npm (`npm install -g jekyll-audit`).
*   **Clear Documentation:** Comprehensive `README.md` and potentially a dedicated documentation site.
*   **Configurability:** Easy-to-understand configuration options (e.g., via a `jekyll-audit.config.js` file).

### 6.2. Performance

*   **Efficient Auditing:** Audits should run efficiently without excessive resource consumption.
*   **Parallelization:** Where possible, audits should run in parallel to reduce overall execution time.

### 6.3. Extensibility

*   **Plugin Architecture:** Design with a plugin-based architecture to allow community contributions for new audit checks.
*   **Custom Rules:** Enable users to define custom audit rules.

### 6.4. Maintainability

*   **Jekyll Versions:** Support a wide range of Jekyll versions.

## 7. Technical Design Considerations

### 7.1. Core Architecture

`jekyll-audit` will likely follow a modular architecture, with a core CLI orchestrator and separate modules or plugins for each audit type. This allows for independent development and easier integration of third-party tools.

```

### 7.2. Technology Stack

*   **Language:** JavaScript/TypeScript (for type safety and better maintainability).
*   **Runtime:** Node.js.
*   **CLI Framework:** Commander.js or Oclif for building the command-line interface.
*   **Testing Frameworks:** Jest for unit/integration tests of `jekyll-audit` itself.
*   **Auditing Libraries:**
    *   Google Lighthouse (via `lighthouse-ci` or direct API) for performance, best practices, and some SEO/accessibility.
    *   `axe-core` or `Pa11y` for accessibility.
    *   Custom or existing npm packages for broken link checking (e.g., `broken-link-checker`).
    *   HTML/CSS validation libraries (e.g., `html-validator`).

### 7.3. Workflow

1.  **Installation:** `npm install -g jekyll-audit`
2.  **Configuration (Optional):** Create `jekyll-audit.config.js` in the Jekyll project root.
3.  **Execution:** Run `jekyll-audit` from the Jekyll project directory.
    *   The tool will first build the Jekyll site (e.g., `jekyll build`).
    *   It will then serve the built site locally (e.g., using a temporary static server).
    *   Each audit module will then run its checks against the locally served site.
    *   Results will be aggregated and presented in the console and/or detailed reports.
4.  **CI Integration:** `jekyll-audit` can be easily integrated into CI pipelines (e.g., by adding `jekyll-audit` to a GitHub Actions workflow).

## 8. Future Enhancements

*   **Custom Rules/Plugins:** A more formalized plugin system to allow users to write and share their own audit checks.
*   **Visual Regression Testing:** Integration with tools like `BackstopJS` or `Percy` to detect unintended visual changes.
*   **Content Linting:** More advanced checks for content quality, readability, and consistency.
*   **Theming/Styling Audits:** Checks for CSS best practices, unused CSS, and consistent styling.
*   **Integration with Jekyll Build Process:** Potentially integrate more deeply with Jekyll's build process to access generated content directly without serving.
*   **Dashboard/UI:** A simple web-based dashboard for visualizing audit trends over time.

## 9. Conclusion

`jekyll-audit` has the potential to become an indispensable tool for Jekyll developers, streamlining the process of ensuring high-quality, performant, accessible, and SEO-friendly static sites. By leveraging existing open-source technologies and focusing on a user-friendly CLI, it will empower developers to build better web experiences with Jekyll.
